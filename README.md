# PROJECT 3 - A FLAG COLLAGE
Due Date: Monday 11/9/2015 at 11:59 pm
For this project, write a program that will create a collage of pictures that resembles the flag of a country. Your collage must be made by copying at least 3 pictures (or parts of 3 pictures) onto a blank canvas. Each of the three pictures must be modified in a different manner. These modification should be done to make the needed colors for the flag of your choice.

# Extra Credit
If the pictures used are thematically related to the country whose flag you chose, you will receive 5 point extra credit.
There will also be an additional 5 point extra credit if your countries flag has diagonal boundaries between colors.

# Modification of the Pictures
The following are examples of modification that you might want to do to the pictures chosen:
- increase some color(s)
- decrease some color(s)
- creating a color negative
- make black and white
- make color and white
- make black and color
- posterization
- flipping, rotating or mirroring the image

Check out examples of flags and an example of a finished example (this is from the original site of this project). As a suggestion, don't use a flag with a complex image/symbol on it. Here is a list of many flags from around the world. Here is another list of flags.

You are to write and use at least two methods for this project. A good idea is to write methods for each of the three modifications. Also, you must hard code the name of the images used for this project. You are not to use pickAFile() to prompt the user for the names of the images used. You may use pickAFile() to determine the directory that all the images are in. You should assume that all of the images will be in the same directory, so once that directory is known to the program, no further prompting from the user is required. Check out the code at Lect1026g.java for an example on how this is done. You may want to use setMediaPath() in the FileChooser class to help read in the needed images.
